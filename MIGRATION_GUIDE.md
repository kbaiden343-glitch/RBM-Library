# Migration from localStorage to PostgreSQL

This document outlines the complete migration of the Robert Aboagye Mensah Community Library Management System from localStorage to PostgreSQL database.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Infrastructure
- **Added PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- **Implemented Prisma ORM** for database operations
- **Created comprehensive schema** with proper relationships
- **Added data validation** using Zod schemas

### 2. API Layer
- **Built REST API endpoints** for all CRUD operations
- **Implemented JWT authentication** for secure access
- **Added proper error handling** and validation
- **Created pagination** for large datasets

### 3. Context Updates
- **Migrated LibraryContext** to use API calls instead of localStorage
- **Updated AuthContext** to use JWT tokens
- **Added loading states** and error handling
- **Implemented proper data fetching** patterns

### 4. Data Models
- **Updated interfaces** to match database schema
- **Changed status enums** to uppercase (AVAILABLE, BORROWED, etc.)
- **Added timestamps** for all records
- **Implemented proper relationships** between entities

## New Features Added

### 1. Authentication System
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure tokens
- **Role-based permissions** (ADMIN, LIBRARIAN, MEMBER)
- **User registration** and login endpoints
- **Token-based API access** with automatic refresh

### 2. Database Operations
- **Full CRUD operations** for all entities
- **Advanced filtering** and search capabilities
- **Pagination** for large datasets
- **Data validation** on both client and server

### 3. API Endpoints
```
Authentication:
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/register

Books:
- GET /api/books (with pagination, search, filters)
- POST /api/books
- GET /api/books/[id]
- PUT /api/books/[id]
- DELETE /api/books/[id]

Members:
- GET /api/members (with pagination, search, filters)
- POST /api/members
- GET /api/members/[id]
- PUT /api/members/[id]
- DELETE /api/members/[id]

Borrowings:
- GET /api/borrowings (with pagination, filters)
- POST /api/borrowings
- GET /api/borrowings/[id]
- PUT /api/borrowings/[id] (return book)
- DELETE /api/borrowings/[id]

Reservations:
- GET /api/reservations (with pagination, filters)
- POST /api/reservations
- GET /api/reservations/[id]
- PUT /api/reservations/[id] (cancel/ready)
- DELETE /api/reservations/[id]

Attendance:
- GET /api/attendance (with pagination, filters)
- POST /api/attendance
- GET /api/attendance/[id]
- DELETE /api/attendance/[id]

Dashboard:
- GET /api/dashboard/stats (with time range filters)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 12+ installed
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Push schema to database
npm run db:push

# Seed with sample data
npm run db:seed

# Test database connection
npm run db:test
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create `.env.local` with:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/library_db"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 4. Start Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Data Migration

### From localStorage to Database
The system now automatically:
1. **Fetches data** from the database on startup
2. **Saves changes** to the database in real-time
3. **Maintains data consistency** across sessions
4. **Supports multiple users** with proper isolation

### Sample Data
The migration includes:
- **Default admin user** (admin@library.com / admin123)
- **Sample books** across different categories
- **Sample members** with realistic data
- **Sample borrowing records** and reservations

## Benefits of Migration

### 1. Data Persistence
- **No data loss** on browser refresh or device change
- **Multi-user support** with proper data isolation
- **Backup and recovery** capabilities
- **Data integrity** with foreign key constraints

### 2. Performance
- **Efficient queries** with proper indexing
- **Pagination** for large datasets
- **Caching** capabilities for better performance
- **Optimized database operations**

### 3. Security
- **JWT authentication** with secure tokens
- **Role-based access control** with granular permissions
- **Input validation** on both client and server
- **SQL injection protection** with Prisma ORM

### 4. Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling** with database clustering
- **Connection pooling** for high concurrency
- **API-based architecture** for microservices
- **Cloud deployment** ready

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database connection failed**: Check PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct
2. **JWT token expired**: User needs to log in again
3. **Permission denied**: Check user role and permissions
4. **Data not loading**: Check API endpoints and network connectivity

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test database connection
npm run db:test

# View database in browser
npm run db:studio

# Reset database
npm run db:reset

# Check logs
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Production Deployment
- Set up production PostgreSQL database
- Configure environment variables
- Set up SSL certificates
- Implement monitoring and logging

### 2. Additional Features
- Email notifications for overdue books
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Mobile app integration
- API rate limiting and caching

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Database indexing optimization
- Query performance monitoring
- Caching layer implementation
- CDN for static assets
